Covid-19 Trend Analysis Project::::

                                         **Short Summary**
**Made COVID-19 prediction model using machine Learning in which we can predict number of Confirmed cases, Number of Recovered cases and
Number of Deceased cases for various states by using Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression.
Also Created the dashboard in Tableau Regarding the same.**
